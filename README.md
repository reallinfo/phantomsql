The PhantomSQL API is straightforward:

```javascript
// New table with two columns
sql.init("user_table", ["username", "password"]);

// Insert new user to table
if (!sql.find("username", "user_table", username)) {
  sql.insert("user_table", "username", username);
  sql.insert("user_tble", "password", password);
}
```

## Install

Clone

```sh
git clone https://github.com/harmankang/phantomsql.git
```
or use npm
```sh
npm install phantomsql
```
and add it to your `.html` file

```html
<script src="phantomsql.js"></script>
```

## Operations

### Create table
Override resistant (i.e. existing table with same name will not be replaced).
```javascript
sql.init("table_name", ["column_1", "column_2"]);
```
### Drop table
```javascript
sql.drop("table_name");
```
### Selecting with condition
Returns value given condition
```javascript
// Read: SELECT column_1 FROM table_name WHERE column_2 = value
sql.select("column_1", "table_name", "column_2", "value");
```
### Find if value exists in column
Returns boolean
```javascript
// Read: SELECT column_1 FROM table_name WHERE column_1 = value
sql.find("column_1", "table_name", "value");
```
### Insert new row
Void return
```javascript
// Read: INSERT INTO table_name (column) VALUES (value)
sql.insert("table_name", "column", "value");
```
### Update existing row
Void return
```javascript
// Read: UPDATE table_name SET column = value WHERE column_2 = value_2
sql.update("table_name", "column", "value", "column_2", "value_2");
```
### Delete existing row
Void return
```javascript
// Read: DELETE FROM table_name WHERE column = value
sql.delete("table_name", "column", "value");
```

## Demo

Check out this [demo](https://harmankang.github.io/web-demos/registration-demo/index.html) that uses PhantomSQL in order to allow you to register, login, change your password, and delete your account.

## Architecture

PhantomSQL is built-on the Web Storage API, specifically the [`window.localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) property. Therefore, the nature of PhantomSQL's functionality corresponds to localStorage:

- It will store data across browser sessions without expiration, even if the browser is closed.
- Data stored using PhantomSQL is specific to the protocol of the page (e.g. `file://` vs `https://`).
- Depending on your browser configuration, PhantomSQL may not work properly for a certain origin (i.e. Web Storage may be denied for a certain protocol, port, or host).

#### PhantomSQL is by no means an actual database. 

With that, it is worth discussing the table architecture.

One or more columns will consitute a table. PhantomSQL creates a "genesis" item and stores it in localStorage. The genesis item `key` is the table name and the `value` is an array of all the column names.

The genesis item is used to generate an additional n items, where n represents the number of columns. The `key` for each these items is equal to the table name with `_x` concatenated on, where `x` represents the column's name. The `value` is set to an array the column data.

> For example, let's create a new table with PhantomSQL:

```javascript
sql.init("users", ["id", "username", "password"]);
```
This will create the so-called genesis item and additional items for the columns:

|Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| users | ["id", "username", "password"] |
| users_id | [] |
| users_username | [] |
| users_password | [] |

> Let's insert a row:

```javascript
sql.insert("users", "id", "1");
sql.insert("users", "username", "jimmy_neutron");
sql.insert("users", "password", "hunter2");
```
This will replace the appropriate items:

|Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| users | ["id", "username", "password"] |
| users_id | ["1"] |
| users_username | ["jimmy_neutron"] |
| users_password | ["hunter2"] |

## Compatibility
*This data corresponds to that of localStorage. 

| | Chrome | Edge | Firefox (Gecko) | IE | Opera | Safari (WebKit) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| localStorage | 4 | Yes | 3.5 | 8 | 10.50 | 4 |
